# Top-Product-Finder
The "Product Classification per Application Script" iterates through specified spreadsheet tabs ("February" to "November"), scanning column J for product mentions and tallying counts into an object. It identifies the top three most mentioned products across all sheets and updates the "Welcome" sheet of the active spreadsheet with these results, displaying them in cells H6, J6, and L6. This script efficiently categorizes and presents the most frequently referenced products within the dataset spanning multiple months, aiding in strategic analysis and decision-making based on product popularity over time.
